# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript_no_enclosure
- Sink: user_error_prm_

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes
