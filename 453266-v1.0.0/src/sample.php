Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: ctype_alpha ==> Filters:[nums, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: pdo_query_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description

<?php
# Init
