Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: mysqli_real_query_method_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Good
