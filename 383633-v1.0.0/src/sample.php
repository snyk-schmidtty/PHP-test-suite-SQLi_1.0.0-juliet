Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<s>(t)_<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Sanitization: ctype_alpha ==> Filters:[nums, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, specials, Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: user_error_prm_
