# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %s)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes

$tainted = $_POST;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
