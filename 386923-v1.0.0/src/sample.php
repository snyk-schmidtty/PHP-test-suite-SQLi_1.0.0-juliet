# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_prm__<c>(ENT_QUOTES) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
