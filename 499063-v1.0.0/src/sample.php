Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %d) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
