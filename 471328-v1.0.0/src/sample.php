# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_prm__<c>(ENT_NOQUOTES) ==> Filters:[Filtered(&, <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(&, <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes
