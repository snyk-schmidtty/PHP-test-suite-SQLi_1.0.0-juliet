Patterns:
- Source: apache_request_headers ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: str_shuffle ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad

# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
-->
<?php
# Init

# Sample
$tainted = apache_request_headers();
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = str_shuffle($tainted);
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = ("Hello" . $dataflow);
vprintf("This%s", $context);
