# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<s>(t)_<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pg_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
-->
<?php
# Init
$db = pg_pconnect("host=postgres-server port=5432 user=postgres password=postgres123 dbname=myDB");


# Sample
$tainted = filter_input(INPUT_GET, "t", FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS);
$sanitized = addcslashes($tainted, ";:'\"");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = (("SELECT * FROM users WHERE pin =" . $dataflow) . ";");
$result = pg_query($db, $context);
while(($row = pg_fetch_row($result)))
{
  echo(htmlentities(print_r($row, true)));
