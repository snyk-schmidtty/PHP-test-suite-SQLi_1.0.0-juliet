Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: str_getcsv_prm_ ==> Filters:[Filtered(,)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(,)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad

# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
-->
<?php
# Init

# Sample
$tainted = $_COOKIE;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = str_getcsv($tainted);
$sanitized = implode($sanitized, "_");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
