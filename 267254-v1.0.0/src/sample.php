Patterns:
- Source: apache_request_headers ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: nosanitization ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: pdo_query_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection

<?php
# Init
$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=mysql;port=3306;dbname=myDB", "username", "password");


# Sample
$tainted = apache_request_headers();

$results = $pdo->query($context);
