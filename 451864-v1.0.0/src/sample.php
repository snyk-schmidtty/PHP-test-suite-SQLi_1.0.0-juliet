# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: getallheaders ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: trigger_error_prm__<c>(E_USER_ERROR)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
2. Apostrophe are useless inside plain html context for XSS
