# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: pdo_query_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
-->
<?php
# Init
$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=mysql;port=3306;dbname=myDB", "username", "password");


# Sample
$tainted = $_COOKIE;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = addcslashes($tainted, ";:'\"");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = (("SELECT * FROM users WHERE password =\"" . $dataflow) . "\";");
$results = $pdo->query($context);
foreach ($results as $row){
  echo(htmlentities(print_r($row, true)));
}
