# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sha1_prm__<false>() ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
