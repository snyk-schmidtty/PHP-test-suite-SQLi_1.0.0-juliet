# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: str_shuffle ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description
