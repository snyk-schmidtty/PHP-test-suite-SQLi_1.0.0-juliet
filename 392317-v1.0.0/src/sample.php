Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript_no_enclosure
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
