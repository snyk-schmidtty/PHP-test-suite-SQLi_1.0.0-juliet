Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pg_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
