# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: nosanitization ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: sqlite3_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
