# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: in_array_prm__<$>(legal)_<true>() ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_quotes
- Sink: echo_func

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
