# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sizeof_prm__<c>(COUNT_NORMAL) ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_quotes
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
