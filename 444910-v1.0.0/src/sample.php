# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param_a
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
