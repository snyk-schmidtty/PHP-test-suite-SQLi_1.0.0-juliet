# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: mysqli_multi_query_method_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
