# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_array_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<array>(<ae_k>(<s>(t),<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES))) ==> Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)
