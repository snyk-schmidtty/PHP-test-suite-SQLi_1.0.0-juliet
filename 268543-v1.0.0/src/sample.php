- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]

- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pdo_prepare_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Bad

# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
-->
<?php
# Init
$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=mysql;port=3306;dbname=myDB", "username", "password");


# Sample
$tainted = $_REQUEST;
