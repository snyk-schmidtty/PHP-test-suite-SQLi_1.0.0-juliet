# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_prm__<c>(ENT_COMPAT) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
