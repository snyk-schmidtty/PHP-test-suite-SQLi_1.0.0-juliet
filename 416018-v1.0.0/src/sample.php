# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %d) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param_a
- Sink: trigger_error_prm__<c>(E_USER_ERROR)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
