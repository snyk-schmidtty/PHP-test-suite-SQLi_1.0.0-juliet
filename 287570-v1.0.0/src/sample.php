Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %s) ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
-->
<?php
# Init

# Sample
$tainted = $_COOKIE;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = sscanf($tainted, "foo %s");
$sanitized = implode($sanitized, "_");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = ("Hello" . $dataflow);
printf("Print this: %d", $context);
