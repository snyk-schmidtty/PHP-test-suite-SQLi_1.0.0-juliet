# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<s>(t)_<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
