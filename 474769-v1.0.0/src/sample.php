Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: str_word_count_prm__<i>(1) ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_apostrophe
- Sink: pg_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape the apostrophe with '
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection

<?php
