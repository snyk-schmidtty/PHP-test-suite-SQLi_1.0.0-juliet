Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: parse_str ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>

<?php
# Init

# Sample
$tainted = $_GET;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
parse_str($tainted, $sanitized);
