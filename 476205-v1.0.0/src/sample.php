Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sizeof_prm__<c>(COUNT_NORMAL) ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
