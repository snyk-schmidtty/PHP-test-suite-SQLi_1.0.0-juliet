Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_array_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<array>(<ae_k>(<s>(t),<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES))) ==> Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Sanitization: soundex ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials, Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
