Patterns:
- Source: apache_request_headers ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: metaphone_prm__<i>(9) ==> Filters:[nums, specials, Filtered(c, d, v, w, g, h, x, y, z)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, specials, Filtered(c, d, v, w, g, h, x, y, z)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: echo_func
