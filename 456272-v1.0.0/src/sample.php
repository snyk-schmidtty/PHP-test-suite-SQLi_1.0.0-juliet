# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: parse_str ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_quotes
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
2. Quotes are useless inside plain html context for XSS
