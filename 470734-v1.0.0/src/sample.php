# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<s>(t)_<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_FLOAT) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: exit

State:
- State: Good
