Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_prm__<c>(ENT_QUOTES) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript
- Sink: trigger_error_prm__<c>(E_USER_ERROR)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
