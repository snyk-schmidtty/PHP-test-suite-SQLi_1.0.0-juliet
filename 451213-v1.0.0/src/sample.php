Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: settype_prm__<s>(bool) ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param_a
- Sink: trigger_error_prm__<c>(E_USER_ERROR)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
