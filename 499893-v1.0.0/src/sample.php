# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: preg_match_prm__<s>(_^[A-Za-z]*$_) ==> Filters:[nums, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: trigger_error_prm__<c>(E_USER_ERROR)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
