Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: fnmatch_prm__<s>(*)_<i>(0) ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: mysqli_real_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad

# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
