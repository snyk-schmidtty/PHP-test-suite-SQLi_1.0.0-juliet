# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: str_shuffle ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: pdo_query_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection

<?php
