# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %s) ==> Filters:[]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param_a
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

<?php
# Init

$tainted = $_REQUEST;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = sscanf($tainted, "foo %s");
$sanitized = implode($sanitized, "_");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
