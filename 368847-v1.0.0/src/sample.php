- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: metaphone_prm__<i>(9) ==> Filters:[nums, specials, Filtered(c, d, v, w, g, h, x, y, z)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, specials, Filtered(c, d, v, w, g, h, x, y, z)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript_no_enclosure
- Sink: user_error_prm_
