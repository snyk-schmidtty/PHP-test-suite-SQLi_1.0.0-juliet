# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: apache_request_headers ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_plain
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %d)

State:
- State: Good

# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
-->
<?php
# Init

# Sample
$tainted = apache_request_headers();
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = addcslashes($tainted, ";:'\"");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = ("Hello" . $dataflow);
