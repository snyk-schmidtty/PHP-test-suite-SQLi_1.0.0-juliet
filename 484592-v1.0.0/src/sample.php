# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES) ==> Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: user_error_prm_

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes
