# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _GET ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: sqlite3_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
-->
<?php
# Init
$db = new SQLite3("/var/www/db/database.db");


# Sample
$tainted = $_GET;
$tainted = $tainted["t"];
$sanitized = addcslashes($tainted, ";:'\"");
$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = (("SELECT * FROM users WHERE pin =" . $dataflow) . ";");
$results = $db->query($context);
while(($row = $results->fetchArray()))
{
  echo(htmlentities(print_r($row, true)));
