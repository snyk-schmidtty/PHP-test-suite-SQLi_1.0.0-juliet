# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %d) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pg_send_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
