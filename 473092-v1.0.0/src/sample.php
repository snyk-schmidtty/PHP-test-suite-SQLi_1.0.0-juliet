# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: json_encode_prm__<c>(ENT_COMPAT) ==> Filters:[Filtered(&), Escape[\](", \)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(&), Escape[\](", \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_quotes
- Sink: exit

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. Escape quotes with "
2. Create script tag with <script>
3. Quotes are useless inside plain html context for XSS
