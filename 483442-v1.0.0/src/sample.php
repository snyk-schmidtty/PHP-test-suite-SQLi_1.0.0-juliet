Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES) ==> Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%s)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes
