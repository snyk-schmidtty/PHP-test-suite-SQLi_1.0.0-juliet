Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<s>(t)_<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Sanitization: sscanf_prm__<s>(foo %d) ==> Filters:[letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[letters, specials, Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
