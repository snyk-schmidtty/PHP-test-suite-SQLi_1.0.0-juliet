# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: sha1_prm__<false>() ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_quotes
- Sink: printf_func_prm__<s>(Print this: %s)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
