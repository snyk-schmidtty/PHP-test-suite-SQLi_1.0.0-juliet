# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: substr_count_prm__<s>(needle) ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pdo_query_prm__<$>(pdo)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description

<?php
# Init
$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=mysql;port=3306;dbname=myDB", "username", "password");


# Sample
$tainted = $_REQUEST;

$dataflow = $sanitized;
$context = (("SELECT * FROM users WHERE pin =" . $dataflow) . ";");
$results = $pdo->query($context);
foreach ($results as $row){
