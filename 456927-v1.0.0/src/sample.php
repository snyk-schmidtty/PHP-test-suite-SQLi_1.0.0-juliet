# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: addslashes ==> Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Escape[\](", ', \)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_apostrophe
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found


# Exploit description

1. Create script tag with <script>
2. Apostrophe are useless inside plain html context for XSS
