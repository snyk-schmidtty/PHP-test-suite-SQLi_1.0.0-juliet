# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: filter_input_array_prm__<c>(INPUT_GET)_<array>(<ae_k>(<s>(t),<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS))) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Sanitization: addcslashes_prm__<s>(;:'") ==> Filters:[][Note: Escapes characters with \ but can be bypassed because \ is not escaped. E.g. \" to bypass the escaping of ".]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_javascript_no_enclosure
- Sink: echo_func

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes
