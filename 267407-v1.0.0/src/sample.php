# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: strtr_prm__<s>(')_<s>(\w) ==> Filters:[Filtered(')]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(')]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: xss_html_param_a
- Sink: vprintf_prm__<s>(This%d)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
